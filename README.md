## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where technology meets creativity!
I designed and developed this single-page portfolio to present my skills, projects, and professional journey in a clean, elegant, and efficient way.

This portfolio demonstrates a blend of simplicity and technical design — it’s fast, responsive, and visually appealing, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React, in extended builds).

---

## 🧠 About the Project

The portfolio reflects my work as a **Software Engineer**, focusing on **frontend design**, **efficient architecture**, and **user-friendly UI/UX**.
It showcases:

* Clean, modular HTML structure
* Sass/CSS3 animations and dark/light theme toggle
* JavaScript-based interactivity
* Integration with **EmailJS** for working contact forms
* Minimal dependency footprint for faster load times

## 🧩 Features

### 🌙 Theme Toggle

A smooth **Day/Night mode** powered by CSS variables and local storage for preference persistence.

### 🧾 Sections

* **Home:** Social links, short intro, and hero animation
* **About Me:** Short personal overview
* **Skills:** Frontend, backend, and tools section
* **Experience & Education:** Timeline-based design
* **Contact:** Interactive form connected to EmailJS

### 📬 EmailJS Integration

```javascript
emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID");
emailjs.sendForm('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', this)
```

Seamlessly allows visitors to contact you directly through the site.

### 🧠 LeetCode & GitHub Integration

Embedded social icons link directly to coding profiles and repositories.

<h3 align="center">✨ Built with code, coffee, and creativity ✨</h3>

Truth said, one of the factors allowing me to realize that I'm indeed _evolving into the Lola Flores of the coding sector_ is that now, I can tell when I should (or shouldn't) overcomplicate my life. As programmers, our main goal is solving problems - and not all issues require the same tools, not even intricate ones.

In this case, the idea I had in mind was simple: a clean, minimalist, compact portfolio allowing users to get a clear insight into who Maria _is_ as a professional. That's why, independently of my toxic relationship with React, NextJS, or Astro, I chose my best warriors: the tools that started it all. My coding roots, so to speak.

## 🖼️ Swiper

Swiper is considered one of the most modern free and open-source mobile touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions - websites, web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps are no exception!

In this case, I found it to be an extremely useful tool to display some of Maria's most recent works instead of listing them:

# 💄 Style

As stated in the previous sections, what inspired the creation of this project was, on the one hand, the **importance and weight that these websites gained in recent times**, as no one would dare doubt that a career portfolio can help illustrate our professional accomplishments, talents, abilities, and attitudes to prospective employers. However, that's definitely not the entire story.

Job searching puts you in a dark place. Day in and day out, you find yourself going through postings and getting asked to do some online assessments, but you rarely get any calls for interviews. We all know the theory: "Take care of your physical, mental, and emotional needs". "Seek support". "Separate your identity from your job status". We all try, yet it feels we are somehow failing at staying focused, as this vicious cycle of constant silence and rejection doesn't truly allow us to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Although these thoughts never leave my mind, today I woke up thinking of the **incredibly talented professionals** I have around - and **Maria** was the first example that came to mind. In all honesty, I highly doubt any employer could find someone as devoted, rigorous, attentive, and capable as she is.

After having my coffee, **I thought of her incredible curriculum**. Many articles and professional successes came to mind, too. For whatever reason, **I imagined a clean, simple, and minimalist platform allowing recruiters to find some useful keywords**, then **jumping into her CV** and finding the woman _I_ see. The professional that _I know_. A simple portfolio built on HTML, Sass, and JavaScript seemed to be the ideal way of expressing not only achievements but also attitudes and intentions. "Green, green... sounds 'sustainable' enough. How about green, then? And her articles... I would love people to _see_ them in the most direct way possible!" Immediately after my coffee, I started working. Why? Oh, my, my...

This person, who happens to be the main protagonist of today's repository, is an **outstanding professional**, indeed. She's even better as a person, though - and if this little "gift" can bring a smile to her face, I can consider myself more than satisfied. She does not deserve less. If anything, she **deserves to be seen and valued**.

# 🥳 Immense thanks to them awesome Sponsors

Now that I irremediably entered the emotional zone, let's not forget that these words, projects, and general mayhem wouldn't exist without the presence, help, and patience of my amazing Sponsor,`@Entreprises LEMRHALI` - the one who gave me an opportunity when others didn't. Funnily enough, I just mentioned that my dear Doctor Maria deserves to be seen and valued, yet I am not quite good at paying attention to my own words and advice.

As you surely know by now, that's only part of the process; eventually, we will all start seeing, understanding, and appreciating the real value inside of us - you included. Because you don't deserve less, either.

For the past, present, and future moments, `thank you`. You are an extremely beautiful human being.
